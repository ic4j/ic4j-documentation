# Introduction

"The Internet Computer is the fastest and most scalable general-purpose blockchain. It extends the internet with computation. Smart contracts (dapps) can run 100% on the Internet Computer as it can serve web contents directly into browsers. Moreover, end users can seamlessly and securely interact with dapps on the Internet Computer. In particular, users in general do not need any tokens to use a dapp nor is it necessary for anyone to download blockchain state to verify correctness of transactions because of the Internet's Computer's groundbreaking chain key cryptography. Users can security authenticate to dapps using internet identity, the Internet Computer's anonymous blockchain authentication framework." https:/dfinity.org/how it works



Some Definitions

Canister : A canister is **much like a process in an operating system like Linux, MacOS, or Windows**. The operating system keeps track of valid memory ranges for a process, while a canister has a boundary on its linear memory that's enforced by the Internet Computer

Canister ICP : Canisters are loaded with Cycles(gas) for Computation.\
\
ICP is burned to obtain cycles. **ICP tokens are used to mint cycles burned by canisters for computation, which acts as a deflationary force**.

NNS : One of the elements that makes ICP unique is the **Network Nervous System (NNS)**, which is responsible for controlling, configuring, and managing the network. Data centers join the network by applying to the NNS, which is responsible for inducting data centers.

SDK: Software Development KIt&#x20;

API : Application Development Interface

Adapter Pattern : Adapter pattern works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces

Agent : Software agent, **a computer program that performs various actions continuously and autonomously on behalf of an individual or an organization**. For example, a software agent may archive various computer files or retrieve electronic messages on a regular schedule.

Method : method is a set of commands or statement which is written to perform a specific task.

Argument: An argument is a value passed to a function when the function is called. Whenever a function is called during the execution of the program, there are some values passed to the function. These values are called arguments.
